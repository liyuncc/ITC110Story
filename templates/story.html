        <h2>Story Title</h2>
        <p>
            Molly's back and feet ached at the mere sight of {{madwords.noun1 }}, who just walked in the door. To the other towns {{ madwords.common_noun1 }} , the handsome men rolling through meant excitement. The travelers would spend their money, spin their tales, and of course seek companionship for the night. But if you were equipping them for their next adventure it meant only one thing; {{ madwords.verb1 }}. Unloading their treasures, carrying armor for them to try on, exchanging everything imaginable. Hauling a {{ madwords.noun2 }} head off a {{ madwords.noun3 }} loses its luster after the hundredth time. But Molly needed this job to network. It was a means to an end. Molly was a decade long veteran of the adventure services trade. She had come to the village at the age of 22 hoping to make it as an adventurer. She had the build for it. Six foot tall and a hundred and seventy five pounds is nothing to scoff at. But alas, Molly had gotten clumsy on occasion. First, there was Constantine. Her original adventuring buddy was so gung ho. They had talked endlessly of a simple {{ madwords.noun4 }}. “Oh yeah, it will be a cake walk!” Constantine said. “Pff, obviously” Molly scoffed. So, with this in mind, Molly didn't see the issue with {{ madwords.verb2 }} twelve bottles of mead before their “cake walk.” Well, the {{ madwords.common_noun2 }} she got from when the widow Constantine {{ madwords.verb3 }} Molly so {{ madwords.adverb1 }} she {{ madwords.verb4 }} have finally vanished. Lifting heavy metal and dragon bone armor does  horrors to the back. “Hello, how can I...” she regurgitated the line with as much ease and thoughtlessness as breathing. A hand gesture— “Oh, that will be 400 pieces of gold.” That's all these adventurers did. Poor {{ madwords.verb5 }} skills to say the least. Sometimes Molly wondered if they were even capable of {{ madwords.verb6 }}.
